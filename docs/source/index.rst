Welcome to SoilPulse's documentation!
=====================================

SoilPulse was a `NFDI4Earth Pilot project <https://www.nfdi4earth.de/2participate/pilots>`_ in which we explored how soil process can be FAIRified to become better reusable.

You will find the project report of this pilot at `zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13911635>`_.

This documentation lives beyond the pilot phase of SoilPulse and shows:

- How soil process data is FAIRified within SoilPulse with some `application examples <application_examples.html#Reusability-application-on-example-datasets>`_ from unstructured published data sets to Reusable data sets.
- What we consider relevant for `Reusabilty of tabular data <FAIR_world/concept_unit_method.html>`_.

Within the pilot we implemented our workflows in the soilpulse python package. 
The application examples are ongoingly further developed with further developments of this package.


This documentation also shows:

- How to install the soilpulsecore package
- As well as the technical docs generated from the docstrings.

You can contribute to or raise issues on the python package on `our github repo <https://github.com/SoilPulse/MetadataGenerator>`_.
