# Concept, Unit and Method assignment

Describing the data with the correct unit assures that data values are interpreted correctly by other users.

By assigning concepts of controlled vocabularies we assure that the same measured parameter is found across datasets.
E.g. **T**otal **O**rganic **C**arbon of a soil sample can be abreviated by "TOC", but other publications may have used the abbreviation "Corg" (Carbon, organic) in their data.
By assigning both to the agrovoc concept [soil organic carbon](http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_389fe908) a semantical consens is assured and users can find data of both datasets.

Depending on the specific research question the method applied to measure a parameter can become of concern, so it is a needed information for reusing data.

The two data providing repositories [Bonares](https://maps.bonares.de/mapapps/resources/apps/bonares/index.html) and [pangaea](https://www.pangaea.de/) are allready using these three metadata information in their metadata schemas.
